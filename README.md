# Open Classrooms Project 8 - Enhance an Existing Project

### Hello and thanks for stopping by!

This repo contains *Open Classrooms Project 8  - Enhance an Existing Project*.  The purpose of this project was to learn to work with an existing codebase, as is realistic for jumping out into the working world. 

The given tasks included:

*	Finding and debugging errors
*	Testing with Jasmine
*	Performing a web audit against the “competition”
*	Enhancing the codebase for better performance
*	Creating technical documentation

The existing code base given for the project is based on **todo-mvc** which you can view on GitHub [here](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc "todo-mvc").

This project was developed and tested on a proxy server. If you would like to clone this project and do not have a proxy server, you can download *live-server* [here] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server "npm live-server"), which is what I used for the project.

To view the web audit and technical documentation for the project please see the accompanying wiki [here].
